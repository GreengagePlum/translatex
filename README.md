You'll find here the TransLaTeX project which aims to translate LaTeX source files (`.tex`) from one human language to
another using automatic translators.

See the full [documentation](https://cassandre.pages.math.unistra.fr/translatex) for details on usage and installation as well as getting a dev environment ready to start contributing.

## Git repository

The git repository of [this project](https://gitlab.math.unistra.fr/cassandre/translatex) follows a clear and determined
structure put forth by Vincent Driessen in his
post "[A successful Git branching model](https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/)".

So don't be surprised by the fact that the `main branch` has few commits. All the development is happening on
the `develop branch`. Before each version, everything is prepared and guaranteed functional to be merged
into `main branch` which only has stable and complete versions.
